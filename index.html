        <h2>Inner meaning of 1,001 Stories.</h2>
        
        <p>
        The name often given to the Thousand and One Nights, a collection of traditional stories from the Middle East, written in Arabic. Scheherezade marries a king who kills his wives after their first night together. She survives by telling him a different story every night. Many popular films, songs and pantomimes are based on some of these stories, such as Aladdin and Sinbad the Sailor.

        <h2>Stories from and within 1,001 (Arabian Nights)</h2>
    
        <p>
        This is a list of the stories in Richard Francis Burton's translation of One Thousand and One Nights. Burton's first ten volumes—which he called The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night—were published in 1885. His Supplemental Nights were published between 1886 and 1888 as six volumes. Later pirate copies split the very large third volume into two volumes. The nights are in the style of stories within stories, and the frame story is The Story Of King Shahryar of Persia and His Brother or The Story Of King Shahryar and Queen Shahrazad, in which Shahrazad tells tales to her husband Shahryar.
